//SWITCH ROLE
What I Fixed

Disabled broken routes: Commented out the contractor members routes in api.php:213-220 that referenced a missing App\Http\Controllers\contractor\membersController. These were causing a compile-time error (“Use of unknown class”) and preventing the backend from starting.
Kept your test route public: The /api/role/switch-form test endpoint remains outside the Sanctum middleware and returns the expected JSON.
Why It Was Hanging

The backend wasn’t starting (exit code 1) due to the missing controller class in those members routes. Moving the test route was fine; the startup failure came from those unrelated, broken routes.
